CS3210: OS Design Syllabus
Date: Fall 2014

## Textbooks
1) Operating System Concepts Essentials, Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne. 2011.
ISBN 978-0-470-88920-6

2) Operating Systems Principles & Practices, 2nd Edition, Anderson & Dahlin, 2014.
ISBN 978-0-9856735-2-9

## Objective
Objectives:  This course should be viewed as the “lab introduction” in the OS
part of the platforms thread.   The issues involved in the design (both
internal and external) of operating systems will be covered in a formal manner,
but this will be supplemented with hands-on practice with the internals of
Linux as an example of a modern OS kernel.

Specifically, at the end of the course, you are expected to have developed the
skills to design, implement, evaluate, and analyze operating system extensions
in kernel and user space to help address parallelism, memory management, and
performance.  You should also have developed knowledge and understanding of
many of the key control systems and concepts used by modern operating systems,
including but not limited to their application to the Linux kernel.

## Topics
Topics:  This course will cover the following material

* Operating Systems definitions
* Booting
* User and Application interfaces
* Syscalls, interrupts
* Memory Control
* Hardware/software coordination (32 vs 64 bit, PAE, caching)
* Swapping, paging, segmentation (multicore)
* Process Control
* Threads (multicore)
* cpu scheduling (multicore)
* process scheduling
* Storage Control
* File systems
* Storage device drivers
* Virtualization/Protection
